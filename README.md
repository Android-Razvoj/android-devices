Android Devices
===============

Android UI statistics for designers, product managers and developers.

Google Dashboards doesn't provide information on the following:

1. What are the popular/existing dp resolutions?
2. What devices could be best used for UI testing for specific generalized size/density bucket combination?
3. What devices could support width configuration introduced with Android 3.2

Besides, this information provides a sneak peak into Android devices market and trends. 

Everybody is welcome to contribute!
